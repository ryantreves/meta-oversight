# meta_oversight
Examining the efficacy of Meta's independent Oversight Board

In this project, I analyzed data on 87 policy recommendations made to Meta by
the Oversight Board (https://oversightboard.com) based on how completely, and how quickly, Meta responds.
I used R for data processing and R Shiny to make a web app, with embedded Highchart plots.
